# Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning

**_Machine learning: field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed_**

Two main types:

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

## Supervised Learning

**Learn through given then "right answers" (gets an input and maps it to an output)**

Applications:

- spam filtering
- speach recognition
- machine translation
- self driving
- online advertising
- visual inspection

**Regression** - algorithm mainly used to predict numbers out of infinite many possible numbers

**Classification** - algorithm mainly used to predict categories (can have any number of categories)

- can have more than 1 input value
- can use a boundary line that determies which category an input belongs in

## Unsupervised Learning

**Finding something interesting (_structure_) in the unlabled data**

**Clustering** - algorithm that groups similar data together into clusters

- Google News: finds articles with similar words and puts them into clusters on its own
- grouping customers: clustering customers to find distinct groups

**Anomaly detection** - algorithm used to find unusual data points

**Dimensionality reduction** - algorithm to compress data into smaller formats
